# Introduction

Since April 2018 I've been working on the [Alan Italian] project, the Italian translation/port of [Anssi Räisänen]'s ALAN StdLib. During this extended work I had a chance to study in depth Anssi's StdLib, and to contribute to its upstream development with some fixes and improvements.

For the Italian port, I've changed some aspects of the upstream library, either due to language and grammar differences between English and Italian, or because I wanted to tweak the library code and behaviour in slightly different directions. 

This project is my personal playground where I test tweaks to the StdLib, in order to experiment new approaches and features — which might be also proposed on the upstream project if they turn out useful, but not necessarily so.
